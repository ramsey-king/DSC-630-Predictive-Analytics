## Summary

Is there a way to predict if a college quarterback will have a successful career in the NFL (National Football League) using their college stats?
This project will help determine the NFL success of a college football quarterback based on their career college football statistics.  A few definitions are necessary at this point. Let us define a successful NFL career as being in the league for at least 5 years, starting at least half of their games at quarterback, and being selected to at least 1 Pro-Bowl.  From this success definition, the most important statistics a college football quarterback can have is 8,100 passing yards or more, and an average Quarterback Rating (QBR) of 135.5 or higher in his career.  The Quarterback Rating (or Passer Rating) helps to determine the passing performance of a quarterback, and is defined by the following formula:  

NCAA Passer Rating = ((8.4 x Passing Yards) + (330 x Touchdown Passes) + (100 x Number of Completions) – (200 x Interceptions)) ÷ Passing Attempts

If a college quarterback meets these metrics, then they will have a higher likelihood of success in the NFL.  Being a successful NFL quarterback has multiple monetary benefits for the player (Quarterback) and for the NFL franchise that employs him.
